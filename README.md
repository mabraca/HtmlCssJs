# HtmlCssJs
Html Js Css Coursera Assessment

this course is the first in a series of courses which, together with a capstone project, comprise the Full Stack Web Development Specialization. However, this course can also be used as a solid stand-alone introduction to the web technologies we will cover.

This course introduces you to these fundamental browser components:

HTML, for the output of text, sound, images and video in a web page,
CSS, for applying style and some behavioral qualities to HTML, and:
JavaScript, for controling the CSS and HTML.
The course was designed with the expectation that you use 3 weeks to work through the material:

1 week for HTML & CSS
1 week for Introductory JavaScript
1 week for Advanced JavaScript
You can look at the course content to see the list of material we will cover. In addition to the video material, there are many practice questions through-out the course to help enhance your understanding. The majority are located at appropriate places inside the lecture videos. At the end of each week is a challenging practical task which is based on the material you learned during the week. These 3 tasks could be used as part of a portfolio which demonstrates your web development skills.

A typical week might take you 3 hours to go through the material followed by 1.5-3 hours to do the graded assessment task. For any queries, you are welcome to post a message in the course forum.

See you in the course!
